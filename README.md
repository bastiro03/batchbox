# BatchBox
This is a collection of some of the batch scripts I've written over the years. I'm no expert, so I'm afraid a lot of them either don't work or just aren't relevant anymore.
## OldVolumeWin10
Slightly simplifies the process to restore the volume slider from Windows 8 in Windows 10.
## macOSVMPatcher
Arguably the most useful program. Patches a VirtualBox VM to make installing macOS on it possible.
## scrolltest
The well-known BASIC program that endlessly repeats the same text string, now ported to batch.
## YourAge/IhrAlter
Simply asks for your age and then outputs it. Available in both German and English.
## EnableNotificationCenter
Forcefully reactivates Windows 10's Notification Center in case you broke it.
## DeathToASC
Kills all processes related to Advanced SystemCare, one of those bloatware "cleaner" programs that nobody needs.
